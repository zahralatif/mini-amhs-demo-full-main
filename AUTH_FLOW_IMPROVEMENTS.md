# Authentication Flow Improvements

## Before (Problematic UX)
```
User visits site → Redirected to /login → Stuck! No clear path to register
```

## After (Improved UX)
```
User visits site → Redirected to /auth → Choose Login OR Register
                    ↓                    ↓
                /login page          /register page
                    ↓                    ↓
            "Don't have account?"  "Already have account?"
                    ↓                    ↓
            Link to /register      Link to /login
                    ↓                    ↓
            "Back to Home"         "Back to Home"
                    ↓                    ↓
                /auth page          /auth page
```
